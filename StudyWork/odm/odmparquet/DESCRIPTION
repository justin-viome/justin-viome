Title: This package converts CDISC ODM Files into parquet 
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Justin Thomson
Maintainer: The package maintainer <justin.thomson@viome.com>
Description: 
  This package creates dataframes that encompass the most important metadata and clinicaldata CDISC ODM elements. Dataframes are then turned into parquet files.
  Each output file includes a pk id (row number) studyname, and a foreign key to its parent.  ODM trees are parsed into tables linked via pk and fk values for future joining.  For example, metadata has a column called "fk_odm" with a value=1 that points to its odm parent.
